Traders said the settlement was in line with expectations but generally good for the share as it resolves another legal matter of the bank's many. The settlement removes a big legal headache, but Deutsche Bank itself said it is still too early to draw a line, considering other open probes. The bank has said that it expects 4Q earnings to take a pretax hit of nearly $1.2B on the settlement. U.S. bank earnings will be the next drivers for the share, according to traders. \")"
